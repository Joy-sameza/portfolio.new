          Hi, I'm Kenfack Sameza I have an Understanding of the relationship
          between design and users through detailed execution and proper user
          experience. I love working on interesting and meaningful projects that
          I can be proud of, and I always strive to create clean, pixelated
          interfaces that are smoothly animated. I prefer to prioritize not only
          code but also quality, perfect graphic design and optimized
          development.
